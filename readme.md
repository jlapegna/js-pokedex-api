#Pokedex App

This app replicates a "Pokedex" and uses the Pokedex API available here (https://pokeapi.co/).

The layout was created using only HTML, CSS and Flexbox. The app's functionality uses only vanilla javascript. Clicking a name in the list brings up the selected pokemon, it's stats and the "Type" catagory changes color according to the type selected.


## Key Concepts

* Layout design with Flexbox
* DOM Manipulation
* asynchronous JavaScript
* fetch() function
* API
* Event Handlers
